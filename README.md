# Hackathon_Oracle

Welcome,

This repository will provide you with an insight into my ability to code with 'Java' through a project I worked on during the time of my internship here in Oracle Dublin as a Solution Engineer.

Revert to the previous page and you will see a list of folders that contain the contents of my work over the past 2/3 years.

Thanks.
