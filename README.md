# Hackathon_Oracle

#### Welcome,

#### This repository will provide you with an insight into my ability to code with 'Java' through a project I worked on during the time of my internship here in Oracle Dublin as a Solution Engineer.

#### Within this directory you will see a list of folders that contain the contents of my work over the past 3 months.

#### Thanks.
